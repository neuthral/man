We have covered a lot of [ADB and Fastboot](https://technastic.com/tag/adb-and-fastboot/)-related topics for Android users so far. ADB commands can be used to perform a host of actions like disabling and removing system apps, unlocking device, getting device information, pulling and pushing APK files, simulating hardware button gestures, and so on. While using commands manually can be painful and hard, tools like ADB AppControl Extended can help you do all these things easily from a user-friendly GUI. If you own a Windows PC, you are in luck because it’s not available for Mac as of now.

I have written dedicated guides laying down the steps to [uninstall system apps on Android devices without root](https://technastic.com/freeze-uninstall-system-apps-android/) for mobile brands like [Samsung](https://technastic.com/remove-samsung-bloatware-safe-to-remove-apps/), [Xiaomi](https://technastic.com/xiaomi-bloatware-list-miui/), [OnePlus](https://technastic.com/oneplus-bloatware-list-oxygen-os-debloater/), [Oppo](https://technastic.com/oppo-bloatware-list-remove-system-apps/), [Vivo](https://technastic.com/vivo-bloatware-preinstalled-apps-list/), [Nokia](https://technastic.com/nokia-bloatware-list-safe-to-remove-apps/), [Realme](https://technastic.com/uninstall-disable-realme-bloatware/), [Huawei](https://technastic.com/huawei-honor-bloatware-list-emui/), etc. You can even find a carefully picked list of bloatware apps that can be removed or disabled using ADB commands. If you are not comfortable with the ADB method to get rid of useless system apps, there’s a great tool as well. It’s called **[Universal Android Debloater GUI](https://technastic.com/universal-android-debloater-best-bloatware-remover/)** which allows you to debloat your Android device safely.

To be honest, the Universal Android Debloater is more user-friendly than ADB AppControl and the best bloatware remover for Android. However, the latter being more multifaceted, it simply is a must-have utility for Android users. The tool also has a full version and it’s called ADB AppControl Extended which requires purchasing a license or activation key for approximately $7.
