Learn Bash Programming

4 years ago
by Linux_Wolfman
Hi there. Are you new to the world of linux and trying to get around the shell?
You want to become more effective hacking around in the terminal? You want to
start scripting and automating repeated jobs. You want to learn bash
programming and become a GURU?
Ok Great! Let’s do it.
Start with learning some of the basic commands that you can run from the shell.
Some commands you will want to learn include: date, ls in order to look at
files and directories, rm to remove files, mkdir to create a new directory,
whereis to find a program or utility’s path that you are looking for, chmod to
set permissions, chown to set ownership, perform commands on multiple targets
with wildcards, and then find files you are looking for with find_command.
Manipulating strings and numbers will be a common task. Compare_strings to each
other, force_strings_to_lower_case_and_uppercase, learn proper escaping_of
strings, string encoding when needed, Convert_hexadecimal_to_decimal format,
Globbing strings to find expected patterns, Arithmetic_operations, loop_through
a_list_of_strings in a script, and return_a_string as the result of a function.
Now if you are ready to get dirty with data, lets learn some more advanced
commands such as cut, grep, awk, uniq, and tr to manipulate streams of data.
These articles show multiple examples of how these commands and shift and sift
through what you are looking for in files.
You are going to want to make your scripts professional and fancy you will need
to parse the command line arguments of the script. Getopts can help with
parsing, you can create professional menu options with the select command and
you can wait_for_user_input, and the read it from the user with the read
command. You can also make it more professional looking playing with colors in
the terminal.
Now in your scripts you want to do some actual coding and programming to make
complex logic in the script so you will need some programming concepts such as
storing command_results_in_variables, conditional_statements like if and else
and the case_command. Loops in bash allow you to iterate through large jobs of
actions. You can do for_loops and while_loops in bash. Arrays are commonly used
in programming languages to store sequences of element data. Arrays can also be
used in bash. You can even make bash into a more strongly typed programming
environment using the declare_command.
Any professional bash person should also be familiar with environment
variables, bash_history and bash_alias to setup and use the shell more
effectively. Be sure to have that knowledge.
Reading from files is critical in bash jobs. Some of the tasks you might want
to learn include reading_a_file_line_by_line or using thehead_and_tail_commands
to read just the beginning or end of a file. If you have JSON data in a file
and want to parse it you can use the jq command for that.
Interacting with websites and web resources you can use the curl command, or
the mail command to send an email from the shell.
Timing and dynamic interaction of scripts with real world events can be tricky.
There are numerous tricks, techniques and commands in bash to help you automate
event handling. For example the yes command, so you don’t have to type ‘yes’
but have it programmatically respond to commands that ask for confirmation. To
pause or sleep in a script master the sleep command, or subtlety different the
wait command, Run_multiple_commands in one bash line using pipes, AND, and OR
operators to sequence and combine tasks. Keep shell sessions open even if you
close the window with the Screen command or the nohup command.
You want to see a variety of typical scripts in action check out 30_examples_of
bash scripts.
Or if you want to get fancy look at these fancy techniques to impress your boss
or colleagues: iterate_over_sequences_generated_on_the_shell, learn about
HEREDOC, tput,_printf_and_shell_expansions how to create awesome outputs with
bash scripts, or use_inotify_and_rsync to create a live backup system using
only a while loop in a bash script.
Finally don’t forget to add_comments_to_your_bash_scripts! It helps others to
read your scripts and it helps you when you come back to them after some time
for sure!
