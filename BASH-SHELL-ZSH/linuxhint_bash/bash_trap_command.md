Bash trap command

3 years ago
by Fahmida_Yesmin
A built-in bash command that is used to execute a command when the shell
receives any signal is called `trap`. When any event occurs then bash sends the
notification by any signal. Many signals are available in bash. The most common
signal of bash is SIGINT (Signal Interrupt). When the user presses CTRL+C to
interrupt any process from the terminal then this signal is sent to notify the
system.  How you can use trap command to handle different types of signals is
explained in this tutorial.
Syntax:
trap [-lp] [[arg] signal_spec ...]
or
trap [action] [signal]

Key         Description
-l          It is used to display the list of all signal names with
            corresponding number.
-p          It is used to display signal command or trap command for
            signal_spec.
arg         It is used to execute a command when the shell receives the signal
            (s).
signal_spec It contains signal name or signal number.


* Trap command without arg value or with ‘-‘ arg value will reset the specified
  signal to its original value.
* Trap command with ‘null’ arg value will ignores the specified signal send by
  the shell or command.
* A signal_spec with the value, exit(0) will execute arg after exiting from the
  shell.
* A signal_spec with the value debug will execute arg before each single
  command.
* A signal_spec with the value return will execute arg each time when a shell
  function executes or a script run by “.”.
* A signal_spec with the value err will execute arg every time on command
  failure.


Trap command without any option and arg

Run the following command from the terminal to display the list of all commands
associated with each condition. If any `trap` command is not set before then
the following command will not display any information.
$ trap

Trap command with -l option

Run the following command from the terminal to display the list of all signal
names with number.
$ trap –l
The output of the above command will show the list of 64 signals with numbers.

Set trap command for ERR and EXIT

The following first command will set a `trap` command that will execute when
any shell error occurs or shell exits. This `trap` command will remove temp.txt
file from the current location. `ls` command is used to check the temp.txt file
exists or not in the current location. Lastly exit command is used to close the
terminal and execute the `trap` command that is set before.
$ trap 'rm temp.txt' err exit
$ ls
$ exit
The following output will appear after running the above commands.
Now, if the user opens the terminal again after exit and executes `ls` command
then temp.txt file will not exist.

Set `trap` command with signal number of SIGUP, SIGQUIT and SIGKILL

The signal number of SIGUP, SIGQUIT and SIGKILL are 1, 3 and 9. The following
first command will set a trap for these three signals. When any of these signal
will occur then the message “Trap command is executed” will print.  Run the
following command from the terminal.
$ trap 'echo Trap command executed' 1 3 9
When the user will press Ctrl+C to generate the signal assign by `trap` command
then the `echo` command of trap command will execute and the following output
will appear.

Set `trap` command for SIGTERM in a script

SIGTERM signal is used to terminate the process immediately by releasing its
resources. Create a bash file named ‘trapscript.sh’ with the following code. An
infinite for loop is declared in the script that will print a text continuously
until SIGTERM signal occurs. The user has to press Ctrl+Z to generate SIGTERM
signal.
trapscript.sh
#!/bin/bash
 
# Set a trap for SIGINT and SIGTERM signals
trap "echo The program is terminated." SIGTERM SIGINT
 
#Display message to generate SIGTERM
echo "Press Ctrl+Z stop the process"
 
#Initialize counter variable, i
i=1
 
#declare infinite for loop
for(;;)
do
  #Print message with counter i
  echo “running the loop for $i times”
  #Increment the counter by one
  ((i++))
done
Run the script by executing the following command and press Ctrl+Z to generate
SIGTERMsignal. The following similar output will appear.
$ bash trapscript.sh

Set a `trap` command to run a function based on particular signal

You can associate a `trap` command with any user-defined function. Create a
bash named trapfunc.sh and add the following script. Here, a custom function
named func() is declared to print a simple message, “Task completed”. A for-in
loop is defined to read and print the list of all files and folders of the
current working directory. `trap` command that is defined in the beginning of
the list will call the function, func() when the program terminates.
trapfunc.sh
#!/bin/bash
# Call func function on exit
trap func exit
# Declare the function
function func() {
 
  echo "Task completed"
}
# Read the files and folders of the current directory list using for loop
for i  in *
do
  echo "$i"
done
Run the script from the terminal.
Run the script.
$ bash trapfunc.sh
The following output shows that, “Task completed” text is printed after
printing all files and folders of the current directory.

Conclusion

This tutorial shows how `trap` command can be used in Linux to do any automated
task based on generated signal. It helps users to trace different types of
errors and take proper action that can be assigned before by using this
command. Many programs or scripts allocate some particular resources when
running in the system. If any running program or script exit or terminate
abnormally then the resources used by that program are blocked. `trap` command
can be used to solve this issue. Resource cleaning task can be done easily by
using this command. Hope, the reader will get a clear idea of the uses of this
command after reading this tutorial.
